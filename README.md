![Design preview for the Devjobs web app coding challenge](./src/design/preview.jpg)

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this jobs board using a local `data.json` to retrieve the data. Your goal is to try to get your project looking as close to the design as possible.

## Users should be able to:

-  View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
-  See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
-  Be able to filter jobs on the index page by title, location, and whether a job is for a full-time position
-  Be able to click a job from the index page so that they can read more information and apply for the job
-  **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.
